## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the labs, ensure you have:
- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- pip (Python package manager)
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DARK-1926/MAD-1-LABS.git
   cd MAD-1-LABS
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If no `requirements.txt` exists, install Flask manually:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Labs

Each lab is in its own directory. To run a specific lab:

1. Navigate to the lab directory:
   ```bash
   cd Lab_X  # Replace X with the lab number
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   # or
   flask run
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   # or
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
